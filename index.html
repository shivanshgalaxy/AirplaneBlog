            <h2 class="heading">What are airplanes?</h2>
            <div class="section">An airplane, or aeroplane, informally plane, is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. These range from small single engined planes commonly used for training and for personal use, to jetliners that can travel the globe, to fighters that keep the skies safe, and many more!

            <h2 class="heading">What makes airplanes fly?</h2>
            <div class="section">
                In straight and level flight, there are four forces that act on an airplane. lift, gravity, thrust and drag. The opposing forces balance each other: Lift equals gravity, and thrust equals drag.
                <ol>
                    <li>Lift: The most critical force in enabling an airplane to fly is lift. Lift is created by the shape of the airplane's wings. The wings are designed with a curved upper surface and a flatter lower surface. As the airplane moves forward, air flows over and under the wings. The curved upper surface causes the air to move faster, creating lower pressure above the wing compared to the higher pressure below it. This pressure difference generates an upward force known as lift.
                    </li>

                    <li>Thrust: Thrust is the forward force that propels the airplane through the air. It is typically produced by engines, which could be jet engines or propellers. The engines push or pull the airplane forward, and this forward motion allows the wings to generate lift.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Weight: Weight is the force exerted by gravity on the airplane, pulling it downwards. To maintain steady flight, the lift generated by the wings must be equal to the airplane's weight. The airplane's design and the distribution of its components, such as the engines and cargo, are carefully balanced to achieve this equilibrium.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Drag: Drag is the resistance encountered by the airplane as it moves through the air. It opposes the forward motion and is caused by the friction between the airplane's surfaces and the air. Pilots and engineers work to minimize drag to improve the airplane's efficiency.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    To take off, the airplane's engines provide enough thrust to overcome the drag and lift the airplane
                    off the ground. During the climb, the engines continue to provide thrust, while the wings generate
                    enough lift to counteract the airplane's weight. In level flight, the forces of lift, thrust,
                    weight, and drag are balanced, allowing the airplane to fly at a constant altitude and speed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The control surfaces of the airplane, such as ailerons, elevators, and rudders, allow the pilot to
                    control the airplane's attitude and direction by adjusting the lift and drag forces on different
                    parts of the wings and tail.
